        <p>The soothing system calms the threat system.</p>
        <p>
          When the threat system is active we feel fear, anger or disgust. We
          also feel strong physical sensations like nausea, a racing heart and
          an urge to fight or run away. This is not our fault – it is just how
          our minds and bodies work. But when this happens, we need to boost the
          soothing system emotionally and physically so that we’re able to slow
          down and feel safe, and not so overwhelmed.

          Have there been any times in the past when you were able to activate
          your soothing system? What did you do? Perhaps you used meditation or
          yoga, remembered to breathe… or connected with a friend or loved one?
          Make a list of any self-soothing skills you already use.{" "}

          Before you begin the process of arranging your cervical screening,
          consider spending some time practicing skills to activate your
          soothing system. Thinking about the test can trigger your threat
          system, so it is important to have these skills ready. We would
          recommend that you try to practice the exercises on this page
          regularly (at least once a day) for the next two weeks.
